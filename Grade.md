
**Feedback**

1) Very well structured readme section. You could have added some more testing instructions. (-1)

2) Try to decode your messages using utf-8. Your messages in the list are not decoded. you can see the u'1234'. (-1)  

3) You could have used processes to start up the different lieutenants, instead of manually starting up the general and lieutenants in different terminals induvidually. Or even a bash script(-2)
